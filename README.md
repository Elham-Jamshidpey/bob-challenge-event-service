# Event-Service

This service is responsible for listening to the events generated by `employee-service` and saving them in its own database. The event-service must also expose a `REST API` that contains just one endpoint to:
   - Get all events related to a specific employee in ascending order, i.e, _the oldest event must appear first_. Response in JSON Array format.
