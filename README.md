# Event-Service

This service is responsible for listening to the events generated by `employee-service` and saving them in its own database. The event-service must also expose a `REST API` that contains just one endpoint to:
   - Get all events related to a specific employee in ascending order, i.e, _the oldest event must appear first_. Response in JSON Array format.

## Required

 - Run the message broker and databases youâ€™ve chosen to store the employee's data and employee event's data in Docker containers (instead of in-memory database).
 - Commit all your development using micro commits and share your project on a `GitHub` repository.
 - Include a **README** file explaining how to build/run your application and any comments you think are important;
 - Unit and integration tests;

## Bonus

 - Use Swagger (https://swagger.io) to expose employee-service and event-service endpoints;
 - Add authentication to access create, update and delete employee-service endpoints;
 - Run the two applications in docker containers as well.
